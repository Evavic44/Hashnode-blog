## How to effectively maximize your day

As a developer, managing your time each day can help you polish your abilities and maximize your effort to produce better outcomes. Just going about your day without knowing what you should be doing, why you should do it, and when you should do it leaves you at the risk of being unprepared and disorganized. 
As a result, it is critical to follow a strategy that not only helps you get things done but also prioritize what those things are.

Effectively planning your day can increase your productivity by a significant amount, if done correctly, it can help you live a healthy, affluent, and happy life.

So without further ado, here are the following steps on how to maximize your day to boost your productivity.

## 1. Have a daily schedule

Make a list of all you want to achieve each day in the evening, prior to the next day. List them out and choose at least three that are the highest priority and focus more on them.

## 2. Set a deadline for yourself.

If you have all your tasks for the day listed out, set a time of the day you hope to achieve them, before the evening, if possible. This will help you stay focused on finishing your goals and better track and manage your time. 

## 3. Break down activities into smaller tasks

Break down each task into smaller chunks to allow you to accomplish them faster. Use a simple to-do app like [Microsoft Todo](https://todo.microsoft.com/) to list out these tasks. For example: If you have a goal of finishing an article in a week, a good task to write on your to-do app could be: "Complete one section today".

## 4. Start early
The sooner you get started, the more you can get done. Learn to be an early riser and take care of personal issues before you begin. Fewer distractions coupled with more time during the day equals more completed tasks.

## 5. Focus on a single task

When you decide to work on a task, make sure you focus on one at a time. Block the temptation of multi-tasking. If you absolutely have to juggle several tasks at once, do it with little tasks and reserve the big activities in its own time.

## 6. Reduce Distractions

It is important to reduce distractions as much as possible when you start your daily schedule. Distraction in this case is anything that takes up the time for another task. It could be social media, reading emails, or receiving and making calls. Have a separate time for these activities.

Of course, I'm not saying you should go about your day like a robot, you can be flexible and have some cool-off time. Just do it in moderation and make sure it doesn't affect your ability to accomplish the day's tasks. 

## 7. Do the hard tasks first

Get the most difficult tasks done at the beginning of the day when your energy is highest so it’s not distracting you throughout the rest of the day.

## 8. Establish strict limits.

Set rules for yourself on how much time you’re going to spend on certain activities. This can help you stay on track with your daily schedule for the rest of the day. Use a time-tracking tool and set alerts when you go over your limit on those activities.

## 9. Have a cool-off time

Make time during the day to relax and unwind after accomplishing a task. Get away from work completely, find something that helps you relax, focus on doing that, and try not to think about work when doing it. You and your brain both deserve a break. 

## 10. Complete is better than perfect

While aiming for excellence is admirable, excessive perfectionism is the most significant productivity drain. Spend more time trying to complete your daily tasks first, and the time to make them perfect can come later.  Why is this important? Because there is a sense of fulfillment when you check every box on your to-do list. This gives you the needed morality boost to do even better the next day. So if you're feeling unproductive, try setting achievable goals each day and completing them.

## 11. Get A Good Night's Sleep

Most developers struggle with this one, myself included, but it is very vital (to your health and productivity) to get a good night's sleep, especially after a long day's work. This will help you regain energy for the next day. On the other side, not getting enough sleep can lead to burnout, which will negatively impact your productivity, so I can't emphasize enough how vital it is. 

## Final Words

Finally, remember that mastering anything takes time and practice, and productivity is no exception. The realistic goal is continuous improvement rather than perfection each day. These tips are what I apply in my daily routine, and it helps me stay productive.
