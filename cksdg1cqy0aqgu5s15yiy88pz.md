## Goals

My primary purpose in joining HNG is to improve my skills as a web developer and collaborate with great people. HNG has given me an amazing platform to showcase my skills while building amazing projects with other engineers. Below is a simple list that elaborates on these goals.


1. Create my first JavaScript project. ‚õëÔ∏è <br/>
    I have very minimal knowledge of JavaScript, though I have built a few projects with it. I seek a broader understanding to have better control of the projects I'm working on.

2. Collaborate with senior developers ü§º <br/>
HNG is packed with both newbie and experienced developers so it is a great place to learn and collaborate. I plan on utilizing this opportunity.

3. Help other developers. üÜò <br/>
I hope to share what I've learned with other developers or those who require assistance with any issue I am knowledgeable in.

4. Win the HNG shirt. üëï <br/>
As Mark would say

    > "That T-Shirt will be a symbol of your grit, your strength, your ability to work under pressure"

    Yes, it's just a simple shirt, but what matters is the symbol of what it represents. 

Having to achieve all I listed above is why joined HNG Internship.

Thanks for reading this article, I'll definitely update my progress as I go and hopefully, make it to the finish line. _See you at the end._
