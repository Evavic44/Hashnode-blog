## Portfolio Ideas - An open-source repository for inspiration

Are you about to build your portfolio, and you don't have any idea of what you want it to look like? Search no more, as I present to you [portfolio ideas](https://github.com/evavic44/portfolio-ideas): A repository of incredible developer portfolios you can draw inspiration from.
It is also a beginner-friendly open-source project for developers looking to contribute for the first time.

## Inspiration
One of the biggest challenges I faced and I know a lot of developers go through when building their portfolio website is not knowing what to put in it or what it would look like, at least this was my own experience. @[Edidiong Asikpo](@didicodes)'s article: [30 web developer ideas to inspire you](https://hashnode.com/post/30-web-developer-portfolios-to-inspire-you-cknfx6wdg069kxws1bjjv8mhw) was very helpful and I thought it would be a good idea to have a similar list but, one that could be updated, and people can add to.

## Overview
There isn't much going on in this project, it's a table that shows a list of portfolios and their details which consists of the following.
1. Author: Portfolio owner's name. This ensures we give attribution to the right creators added to the repository.
2.  Screenshot: A screenshot of the portfolio website homepage is added so you don't have to click the link before knowing what it looks like.
3. Live URL: Link to visit the portfolio website.
4. Repository Link: Link to the source file or code of the portfolio. This is not a mandatory field because not all portfolios will be available on GitHub or even shared by their authors.
5. Tech Stack: The technologies used in building the project. Since some portfolios might have a monstrous number of technologies, this project only captures the essential or primary technologies used in building it.

### Step 2. Create a new table
The portfolio examples are enclosed between two comments: These comments are just guides and don't affect the project in any way.

- `<! -- ⭐ PORTFOLIO LINE START ⭐ -- >` 
- `<! -- ⭐ PORTFOLIO LINE END ⭐ -- >`

![Portfolio Comments](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1654177008207/D4HiUtiZz.png align="left")

To add a portfolio, you can either create a new table or copy an already existing table and edit it, your choice.

### Step 3. Add Portfolio Details
In the new table, start each column with a `|` symbol followed by the column content:

### Author Name
Start a new line below the latest portfolio and add the author or creator of the portfolio website, like so: `| Jemima Abu`

### Screenshot
Visit the portfolio website and take a screenshot of the homepage, drag and drop it into the screenshot column. Please, before adding the screenshot, use services like [tinypng.com](https://tinypng.com) or [compressor.io](https://compressor.io) to optimize the image sizes.

### Live URL
Add the live link to the portfolio website. **PS:**  Omit the https:// in the square brackets `[ ]` and add it in the normal brackets `( )`

### Repo
If the portfolio is available on GitHub, add the repository link, if not, just write **"None"**

`[GitHub](https://github.com/jemimaabu/portfolio)`

### Tech Stack
The next and final thing to add is the tech stack of the portfolio website. You can use [wappalyzer](https://wappalyzer.com), or any other service you know to detect the stack.

If the portfolio is available on GitHub, use the languages auto-detected by [GitHub Linguist](https://github.com/github/linguist). Don't worry about trying to add the complete stack, just the primary language/tools are fine. Example `HTML, CSS, JavaScript`

### Step 4. Preview and create a PR
Now we are done adding all the portfolio information, preview the portfolio added and make sure it corresponds with the table, then raise a pull request.
