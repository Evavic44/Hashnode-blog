## I Built Hashnode's Landing Page Clone With SASS

I recently learnt Sass and have been thinking about what project to build with this CSS Preprocessor, so I decided to do a little research on popular projects to build for your portfolio. 

I didn't want to build the next **to-do list** or **calculator app** üòÖ More importantly, I needed a project that had more presentation than functionality to fully get my hands wet with SASS.

This lead me to @[Giray's](@giray) question on how to create a Hashnode clone.

So I decided to create a static clone of Hashnode's landing page using HTML, SASS, and JavaScript.

# What I learned
While building this project, I learnt a really useful trick that I think is worth mentioning:

### How to get an SVG icon using developer tools. ü§Ø
If you look at <a href="https://hashnode.com/">Hashnode's</a> website, you'll notice a lot of custom SVG icons and illustrations being used. I learnt a neat trick on how to get these icons using the developer tools, which works on any website on the internet. To get the icon, right-click on the SVG icon and select inspect. 

This will open up the dev tools with the icon selected. 
Next, right-click on the SVG Element and select **Edit as SVG**.

Copy the SVG code and paste it into a new file with a ```.svg``` file extension.

To Edit the created SVG icon, I used <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jock.svg">SVG</a> extension on VS Code to preview the icons while editing.

# What Next

It was quite fun and challenging to build this clone. Learned quite a lot, and also got an open source idea I will be working on hopefully. üòÖ

At this point, I'm quite comfortable with this project and I feel it has given me a lot of use case and hands-on experience in working with SASS.  When I have the time, a few things I might add to this project would be,

- Implement the dark mode.
- Add the functionality for the dropdown toggle button.
- Add more pages, ETC.
